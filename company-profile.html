   <h2>Welcome to my website!</h2> 

   <img src="/images/peter peabody.jpg">
   <p id="about">I'm Peter Peabody, an experienced and dedicated driving instructor based in Basingstoke and serving the surrounding areas. With a passion for helping people gain their independence and confidence on the road, I am committed to providing top-quality driving instruction tailored to each student’s needs.

       My Journey
       
       Having spent several years working for a large driving school, I gained invaluable experience teaching learners of all backgrounds and skill levels. I have helped countless students pass their driving tests and become safe, responsible drivers. Now, I am excited to be working independently, bringing my years of expertise and personalized approach directly to you. Going freelance means I can offer more flexibility in scheduling, a more personalized teaching approach, and competitive pricing.
       
       My Approach
       
       Every driver is unique, so I adapt my teaching style to suit your learning pace and preferences. Whether you’re a first-time learner, need a confidence boost, or require refresher lessons, I’ll be there to guide you every step of the way. My patient and friendly manner creates a relaxed and supportive environment, making the learning experience as enjoyable and stress-free as possible.
